# Customer-Behavior-Dashboard
n this project, I analyzed 3,900 customer transactions to uncover insights into spending behavior, product performance, and subscription impact. Using Python (Pandas) and SQL, I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and aggregation to identify trends related to shipping type, discounts, and seasonal purchasing patterns.
